## IADS

An Integrated Air Defence System is a wide network of surface-to-air forces that work together to defend the skies of a specific area. There are several elements that are part of this network, and they are the following

### Command Centre
This is the head of the entire system. The commanders and their staff that direct, and coordinate the forces on the ground. Needless to say, this is the most valuable section of the network, its position is usually concealed and possibly well protected.

Even if it's possible to move around a command centre, it comes with its own limitations: it needs to reroute and build again all the communications between the elements, and it's very much limited in function during the transfer.

### SAM Site
This element is the actual threat, it can be a big and scary SA10 or a smaller SA8 that falls into the network.
They can be a single section, or an entire cluster that is trying to defend an high value target.

Example for this, are SA10 battalion protected by Shilkas, and Tonguskas to help against low level threats, like cruise missiles, low level strikes or helicopters.

SAM are usually static, but for concealment and defence, they can be moved around. Older systems takes days to disassemble, move and assemble, while more modern Russian variants can take just hours.

To avoid detection as long as possible, usually SAMs are kept silent until a target comes into range, and depending on the SAM, it can take some time to launch their missiles.

Better trained SAM crews will shorten this time for the acquisition of enemy aircraft, and usually will wait for it to get closer to a NEZ range [ No Escape Zone ] before launching.

SAM sites can be present in the theatre, but not connected to the IADS, and this would be the case for smaller section that are integrated with ground forces, and work with them to support them directly.

### EW Radar
Early Warning Radars are the sentinels of this network. They scan the skies constantly, and feed informations to the command centre and the SAM sites.

They can be within a big cluster of air defence, or they can be placed around the territory, for example on the higher hills, to have better range.

Their purpose is to pick up the contacts as far and as quick as possible, to relay info up the chain, so the command and SAM sites can prepare to face the threat, and organise together with other element to ensure success.

Big SAM sites like SA10 can have more powerful radar than an usual EW radars. The S-300PS 64H6E radar can cover 160km and a EWR 55G6 instead reach 120km. In such cases, the 64H6E can be used as an EW tool, if the network would benefit from his coverage.

They can also be moved quite relatively quickly, but they are often placed in strategic position to cover a better area. They are also smaller in size, and harder to spot.

### Connection Nodes
Depending on the geographical size of the area, the current available infrastructure, and the technology available, IADS may have connection nodes.

These are systems that can pass messages, data and other kind of informations. They are basically informations highways, and let all the pieces of the network working together

They are usually Antennas that are placed in key position to catch messages from other elements in the network, and relay them, overcoming geographical limitations like mountains.


### Power Sources
This is a general label to indicate what is feeding power to the system, and usually are power plants that give power to entire grids.

Many elements can have autonomous power, like SAM systems don't need to be latched to an external power source to function fully.

But to work as a network, an IADS requires a Power source to operate.

### AWACS and Ships
If they are integrated in the command structure and\or organisation, these entities can feed informations to the IADS through connection nodes.

## How to neutralise the IADS
SEAD and DEAD missions are key to work against this systems, but this is how to direct them.

## Power Sources destruction
Depending on the campaign ROE, the destruction of power plants could be allowed. Cutting power to the IADS will force all the SAM site to work autonomously, and being unable to feed each other informations, listen to EW, and coordinate with their command unit.
This would result in all the SAMs turning on their sensors, and revealing all the information through the emitters.

## Command Centre destruction
Beheading the network will result in general disarray and inability to cooperate, and forcing local commanders to take decisions on their own. Most likely SAMs will operate autonomously, or do nothing during the wait for new orders

## Comuncation Node Destruction
If those are discovered and identified, the destruction of this nodes will degrade the ability of the IADS.
Could force SAMs some connected via that node to function autonomously and not inside the network.

## EW Radar destruction
Blinding the IADS means that they will be forced to rely on other radars with less power, or worse positioning, creating blind spots where to operate freely.
SAMs sites could be forced to turn their radar on to try to locate possible threats, giving away their position.

## SAM destruction or suppression
SAMs can be engaged with several HARMs or Standoff weapons. If a precise location is discovered, a precise standoff attack can be launched. With less information at hand, HARMs can be used to be launched on enemy radars, forcing them to turn off their emitters and go blind.


## IADS Tactics

### HARM defence
SAM sites and EW radars will shut down their radars if they believe a HARM (High speed anti radiation missile) is heading for them. For this to happen, the SAM site has to detect the HARM missile with its radar.

They will not shut down for each HARM launched in the air, but they will calculate if a missile is going to land close enough to their position, and if so, they will turn silent and stop feeding information to the HARM missile.

### Point defence
If an HARM was launched on an emitter, other friendly radars that are close enough can detect the missile incoming and intercept it with their own weapons.
For this are required more modern radars, that can pick up the RCS of an HARM missiles. SA10 and SA15 are powerful enough to employ this tactic

### Jamming
IADS network can produce jamming to fight enemy sensors. But more intel is needed on this topic
