# Syria as a Candidate for Air Attack

This document is a systematic study into Syria as a candidate for a potential air campaign

---

## Section I: Introduction

### 1. Purpose

This study format is designed to analyze the economic, political and military structure of Syria as a candidate for air attack. All section will not apply in all cases.

### 2. Scope

No speculation is included as to possible locations of forward bases. Likewise the specific strength of the required air force has not been considered.

### 3. Guidance

The national structure of a country may be divided into five general classifications:

<ol type="a">
  <li>Fielded military forces</li>
  <li>Population</li>
  <li>Infrastructure</li>
  <li>System essentials</li>
  <li>Leadership</li>
</ol>

Each of the above elements, as they exist in Syria, will be considered in the following sections as a possible candidate for air attack.

## Section II: Air Force Objectives

### 5. General Principles

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    The socioeconomic structure of modern nations is highly integrated. The rapid parallel destruction of selected critical vulnerabilities associated with a nation’s centers of gravity may bring a succession of collapses in related areas until the entire system’s structure collapses or the concerted pressure persuades the enemy’s leadership to end the conflict.
  </li>
  <li>
    A vital objective of air forces is affecting such centers of gravity. Air forces so employed exploit to the maximum their outstanding capability to reach and affect distant surface targets of whatever character; aerospace power accomplishes the objectives of strategy by assuming the strategic offensive.
  </li>
  <li>
    Since aerial forces can fly over natural obstacles and fielded military forces, they can reach and affect any center of gravity known to exist within the enemy national territory. Affecting such centers of gravity may be constrained by the number of individual targets needed to achieve the desired effects, by limitations in friendly capabilities, by political or moral considerations, and by the opposition of air defenses.
  </li>
</ol>


### 6. Air Defence

It is self-evident that air defences can reduce the efficiency of - but not prevent - air attack.

### 7. Ideal Aerospace Objective

From the above it follows that the ideal objective for aerial attack are undefended centers of gravity of the enemy national structure.

### 8. CJTF objective in war with Syria

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    The recent activities of the country indicate that in a war, the CJTF objective would be to restore borders and to force Syria into changing its current political and military ambitions in the region.
  </li>
  <li>
    Deterrence and preventing further military action does not necessarily require occupation of enemy territory if political acquiescence and acceptance of terms can be forced by reducing the will and ability to project power.
  </li>
</ol>

### 9. Applications of Principles to this Study

Succeeding sections of this study will endeavor to prove:

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    That Syria is a modern, structured nation, and therefore - in general - vulnerable to attack.
  </li>
  <li>
    That within Syria, there are centers of gravity consisting of a finite number of targets - or target systems.
  </li>
  <li>
    Affecting such centers of gravity with aerial forces can accomplish, or make a decisive contribution to the probable objectives of the CJTF.
  </li>
</ol>

## Section III: Environment

### 10. Geographical

Syria, with its capital Damascus, is one of the larger countries in the region - located in the Middle-East, with Turkey to the north, Iraq to the east and Jordan and Israel to the south. To the west lies the Mediterranean sea, and its border with Lebanon.

The climate is mostly dessert; hot, dry, sunny summers (June trough August) and mild, rainy winters (December to February) along the cost - with colder weather and snow or sleet periodically in the Damascus area.

The terrain is primarily semiarid and desert plateau; narrow coastal plain; mountains in west.

### 11. Population

Significant population density along the Mediterranean coast; larger concentrations found in the major cities of Damascus, Aleppo (the country's largest city), and Hims (Homs); more than half of the population lives in the coastal plain, the province of Halab, and the Euphrates River valley.

Syria has a population of approximatly 19 million, with 50% being Arabs, 15% Alawite, 10% Kurds, 10% Levantine and 15% others.

87% of the population is Muslim, with 74% Sunni and 13% Shia, Alawi or Ismaili, and 10% Christian. The remaining 3% is Druze or Jewish.

### 12. National Character
